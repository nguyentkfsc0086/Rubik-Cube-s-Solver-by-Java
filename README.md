# Rubik-Cube-s-Solver-by-Java
Apply Graph Theory to solve a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube
There will be some logic errors in this project, will fix it in the summer, after my final exam.
Need to double check the Cube's State before create the new state
Apply real DFS into this project
Maybe change the way to represent the cube
